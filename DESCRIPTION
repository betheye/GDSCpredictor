Title: Predict Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Cell Lines Using Machine Learning
Version: 1.2.0
Author: Xinmiao Wu [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Xinmiao Wu <Xinmiao.Wu23@student.xjtlu.edu.cn>
Description: Provides trained machine learning models to predict drug sensitivity 
    (LN_IC50) in cancer cell lines using genomic and drug features from the GDSC 
    database. The package includes XGBoost (optimized for efficiency) and Ridge Regression for 
    superior generalization. It enables single-sample and batch predictions, 
    supports automated One-Hot/Frequency/Target encoding, and provides 
    interpretation of sensitivity status. Validated with extensive generalization 
    analysis (LODO/LOCO).
